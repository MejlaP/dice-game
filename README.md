# Scrimba - Challenge: Dice Game
## Make it your own

This project is based on the project, which is a part of The Frontend Developer Career Path. In the course, the Dice Game was created for two players.
I remade the game as a single player game. The computer plays automatically after the player rolls the dice.
I also changed the visual aspect of the game a little bit.
